                <p>Erin groaned and sat up straighter. Zach’s forefinger pissed her off, as it poked her 
                    awake each time she tried to get a little shuteye. Turned out he was some sort of green-eyed, 
                    dark haired, human-sized hawk, who didn’t miss anything, though his eyes were supposed to 
                    be on the house across the street.</p> <br>
                <p>“I’ve probably got bruising in my ribs from all that,” she said grumpily and grabbed 
                    the cup of soda they’d been sharing. Disgusted, she threw it back on the rental car’s 
                    dashboard, “And you’ve drank it all too.”</p><br>
                <p>Zach ignored her grumbling and gestured to the two-storey house they’d been 
                    observing. “There’s been some movement in the last few minutes, but we’re going to have to 
                    get closer.”</p>  <br>
                <p>“You mean I’m going to have to get closer, don’t you?” Erin said, still annoyed at the 
                    lack of soda.
                    Letting her sarcasm fly over his head, Zach handed her an earpiece which she 
                    immediately inserted. Their job required them to be in constant contact and this, along with a 
                    few other hidden gadgets found in her black jeans, tank top and leather jacket, all worked 
                    together to ensure that neither of them got into too much of a bind and could be easily 
                    extracted if they did.</p>          
            <br><p>“One time around and that’s that,” Zach said in warning and Erin nodded. She’d been 
                known to go off course more often than their employers liked and Zach was usually the one 
                cleaning up the mess.
                </p> <br>
                <p>“I know, I know, leave the hard work to the big boys.” She pulled her dyed curly red 
                    hair back with a band and got out of the car, her soft-soled black ankle boots allowing her to 
                    stealthily make her way to one side of the house. The deep quiet was unsurprising at well past 
                    two in the morning. Erin peered into one of the windows, the specially made contacts she 
                    wore allowing her to see through the darkness. Being a warden meant quiet, quick and most</p>
