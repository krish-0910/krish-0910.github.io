                <p> of all, unseen. She and Zach had been partnered up for just over two years and she often liked 
                    to say that she did all the hard work, while he got to stay in the van. </p><br>    
                <p> “Do you think this was a legit call Zach? Seems pretty good here to me,” Erin 
                    whispered when she’d made a full circle of the house. Her Barbadian accent came through 
                    too loud over the wire. </p><br>
                <p> Zach adjusted the levels before answering, “It came straight from head office, so 
                    something has to be happening here, they’re just not sure what.” Erin stood from her 
                    crouched position and looked around the large backyard. The night was still and for a 
                    moment she wished she was tucked safely in one of the beds in this neighbourhood. She 
                    couldn’t remember the last time she’d slept in an actual one. She turned to retrace her steps, </p><br>
                <p>“Heading back to you Zach, maybe we can take a break, get something to eat or . . .”
                    “Erin, third window on the left, go now!” The urgency in Zach’s voice got her 
                    moving and Erin ducked down again, making a dash for the other side of the house that Zach 
                    had indicated she should check out. Her heart beat faster and she could feel beads of sweat 
                    gathering at her temples. This always happened when there was about to be a sighting.  </p><br>
                <p> “Erin, hurry,” Zach urged, as if she wasn’t already. She raised herself up slightly 
                    when she reached the window and did so until she could see into the room. At first she saw 
                    nothing but furniture and scattered toys.  </p><br>
                <p> “Have I missed it?” she asked Zach anxiously, not wanting his answer to be ‘yes’ and 
                    face another meeting where their handler Damian, would emphasize how disappointed he 
                    was in them. 
                      </p><br>
                <p> Zach’s answer came in a hushed tone, “Look up.” </p><br>
                <p>  Erin did as she was told and turning her gaze to the ceiling, saw exactly why they’d 
                    been sent to the backwoods of Kentucky. An old woman, naked and emaciated, clutched the 
                    wooden ceiling. She was sniffing the air, moving slowly towards the stairs that would lead 
                    her to the sleeping occupants. Chills ran through Erin at the sight – a soucouyant. They were 
                    wicked little creatures that sometimes shed their skin when they were ready to hunt and took 
                    the blood of others for their own gain. They did this every few years, a process that allowed 
                    them to recapture their youthful beauty, before their true haggard appearance took over once 
                    more</p><br>
                <p> “She’s a mean looking one,” Erin said softly, watching the woman’s progression, 
                    “Don’t they have kids in there as well Zach?” </p> <br>
                <p> Zach issued another warning, “In and out Erin, that’s our job. Containment will come 
                    deal with her.” 
                    Erin tried again, “But Zach, we can at least scare her off a little and then …”
                    “No,” he said sharply, “In and out, now, before she can drink Erin.”  </p><br>
